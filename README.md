.sky blue

.Blue

Buttons: Each button lights up with its respective color.

How to Play

Initial Sequence: Simon starts by lighting up one of the colored buttons .

Player's Turn: The player must press the colored buttons in the exact sequence that Simon played. The sequence will get longer each time the player successfully replicates it.

Increasing Difficulty: With each successful repetition, Simon adds a new color to the sequence, increasing the difficulty. The game continues to build on the sequence until the player fails to replicate it correctly.

Game Over: If the player presses the wrong button or fails to keep up with the sequence, the game ends. The unit typically indicates this by game over .
